          I am a RevoU bootcamp graduate with a strong interest in software
          engineering, and I am excited to start my career as a Front-End
          Developer. Despite my different professional background, through my
          bootcamp experience, I have gained proficiency in technologies such as
          React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, and Python. My time management
          skills are demonstrated by handling flash sale orders, prioritizing
          tasks based on tight deadlines to ensure that all work is completed on
          time. Additionally, I am very comfortable working in a team. During
          group projects in the bootcamp, I collaborated with team members from
          diverse backgrounds, sharing ideas and working together to achieve
          common goals. I am always open to feedback and help from other team
          members, which has strengthened my teamwork skills. While my
          communication skills still need improvement, I can effectively convey
          ideas and solutions when I am well-versed in the topic. With strong
          time management skills, teamwork, and a desire to continuously learn,
          I am highly motivated to develop my skills further through real-world
          projects in software engineering, especially in front-end development.
